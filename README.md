# hero-game

## react-hero-game

An implementation in React of the hero test

Steps:

- cd /react-hero-game

- npm install

- start: npm run dev

- test: npm test

For this I have wrote unit tests for some of the components just to show the testing skills. If all the components needs unit tests, I will write, but it will take more time

## node-hero-game

An implementation in NodeJS of the hero test

Steps:

- cd /node-hero-game

- npm install

- start: ./start.sh

For this one, I did not write tests. Usually, I write tests for everything, but I thought the UI ones are enough to show my unit-testing skills. If they are not enough, I will be more than happy to test everything - it will take some time.
